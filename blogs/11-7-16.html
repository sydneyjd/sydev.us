      Hello again,
      <br>
      Hmm, I am not sure what to make the "theme" of this blog, so as the title says, I guess it will be just be
      a bunch of "random nothings".
      <br>
      I have really been digging to find some sort of static site generator for this site, since i'm still manually
      editing a HTML file by hand. I guess i just could use a bash script of some sort, but i have never dealt
      with coding(nor do i really want to), or figuring out a rather complicated(or so it seems to me) bash script.
      I guess i will have to figure out something eventually. I mainly just want a bash script that take the text i
      input and sticks it in a HTML file that it copies. Oh well, i will have to write one.
      <br>
      I did switch this site to having Github repository for this site, so now i have versioning control, and it save
      me the effort of manually uploading each updated file through SFTP, as the now server now automatically pulls the updates.
      <br>
      Anways, i really need to post about something interesting some time, not just my usual rambling, but oh well,
      I will try to when i think of something. :-)
