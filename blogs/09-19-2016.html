      Hello all who read this post. So, as you can see, I am starting a blog to acompany my new website.
      Im hoping that everyone who visits this blog will learn something, and that i will learn stuff through it as well.
      Even though im not sure how often i will post to this blog, i hope to do more then to just show how things are done,
      but to also explain how they are work.
      <br>
      As you may have noticed, I try to keep this website lightweight, minimal and responsive.
      Im a big fan of clean and simple HTML/CSS websites that are not made entirely of Javascript, and are informative.
      This is also one of my first attempts at a website.
