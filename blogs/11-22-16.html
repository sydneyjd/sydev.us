So i am rather excited about this, but over the past couple days i have
been working at putting together a script to throw up blog posts quite
quickly. It mainly just uses sed(1), along with a couple other bash
commands to edit files and to place answers in strategic files. Its
really quite handy.
<br>
The server that this website is hosted on is a <a
href="http://lowendspirit.com/">Lowendspirit</a> OpenVZ server, with Nat
IPV4 and a /80 IPV6 block(which i might bring up later).<br> I was using
Cloudflare to do the reverse proxying initially, but to me, Cloudflare
seems a bit too intrusive, and they don't document stuff very well, so
now i am using a reverse proxy set up using haproxy, which seems to be
working quite well.
<br>
This post was partially just a test to try out my new script. :-)
