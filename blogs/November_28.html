 Hello Everyone, If you live in the US, i hope your Thanksgiving was
great, and if you don't live in the US, i hope you had a great weekend.
<br> <br>
 This website creation script is definately WIP, it keeps breaking
things. Ugg.
<br> <br>
 So i've had a bit of an adventure recently trying to set up OpenVPN on
my LowEndSpirit VPS. I mainly wanted to set it up to be able to tunnel
IPV6 over my IPV4 connection, but i ran into a few "roadblocks" along
the way.
<br> <br>
 First, i cannot just pull random IPV6 addresses out of thin air, so to
speak, on this VPS I'm limited to manually assigning 5 /80 IPV6
addresses, which means, if i understand correctly, that
OpenVPN cannot just grab an IPV6 address for each client. That then
means that i need to use my server IPV6 address, but NAT it to each of
the (I know thats not the right phrase) IPV6 address OpenVPN gives to
its clients,
but that doesn't work because this is an OpenVZ server, and either the kernel is too old, or they don't
have the IPV6 NAT module enabled.
<br> <br>
 It does seem that i have the option to employ a tunnel from HE, or some
other site, and use it to make it work, but the solutions i have seen
are very hackish and i think i will just wait untill i get a proper KVM
VPS to get this working.
<br> <br>
 Fun Fun...
<br> <br>
 So i guess i will just use my IPV4 only VPN to access the interwebs and
my other machines when i go away from home.
<br><br>
I realized that there
is quite alot of documentation on how to set up OpenVPN, and if you try
to understand what you are doing, its not extremely hard to set up.
The <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/OpenVPN"> Debian wiki</a> does a
decent job of documenting how to do it, but i don't like the "just run
these commands, and everything *should* work" approach to doing it, so I
prefer the <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/OpenVPN"> Arch
Wiki's</a> docs, or even the <a
href="https://openvpn.net/index.php/open-source/documentation/howto.html">
OpenVPN site</a> has nice documentation as well.
<br> <br>
 I don't generally like doing step-by-step how-to's, since they get
outdated and really are clumsy to make and keep up to date, so i won't
make one here.
There are enough how-to's out there on OpenVPN.
<br><br>
 So anyways, that wraps up this post, i ran out of things on my brain to
spew about. I also really need to implement markup to HTML coversion
into this website script as well. *facepalm*
