      So,
      <br>
      it has been a rather hectic past couple weeks, due to multiple factors.
      <br>
      First of all, two weeks ago my Grandpa, who i was rather close to, passed away, and it has been
      dificult for the whole family to re-adjust to not having him.<br>
      It has also been rather busy on the farm. We chopped roughly 700 tons of corn and now are starting
      to combine the drier corn. I love the smell of the corn as we dry it to store in the storage bins.<br>
      Among other things, im rather excited about the progress Firefox is making in
    <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Electrolysis">Electrolysis,</a> the attempt to bring multi-processes to Firefox.
    In Version 49 which was released 3 weeks ago, they have it enabled for 100% of users who don't have addons or have
    known electrolysis compatable addons. For the testing i've done, it makes Firefox a much perkier browser that can now handle
    these extremely overloaded JavaScript websites with ease. YAY!! <br>
    Other than that, i think that wraps up this blog post, im going to have to improve on how i do this, but over time i will learn.
    Thats how we all learn, or so i think.
